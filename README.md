# Reminder companion addon for Hardcore (HC)

This addon has a singular purpose, remind you every 10 minutes that you need to /reload to save your HC progress.

Lose your progress no more!

## Roadmap

If there's a need for it, I might add more options:
- customizable interval
- sound toggle
- alert positioning
- alert message

This isn't supposed to be much more complicated than that to be honest, so let's keep it at that :)
